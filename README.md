# Computer Networks

This project was developed as part of the Redes e Computadores (RCOM) course to create an FTP download application and explore the configuration and operation of computer networks. 

Through this project, we gained a deeper understanding of network communication and the RFC 959 protocol, including networking configuration and performance analysis.


## Quick Start
1. Insert the **ftp url** in the `URL` field on the [Makefile](Makefile).

2. To use the FTP download application, run the following command:
```bash
make run
```

3. After transfer, you can find the downloaded files in [downloads/](downloads/) folder.
